## Ideology

It's not long before someone will come along and make a mainstream vaporwave-based televistion show. 

Let's do it first. Or at least better.

(If [12 oz Mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI1NvBQfH9A) could do it, I think we can, too.)

## Project Goal

Develop an 11-minute Adult Swim-style television show called "Sapporo VHS".
